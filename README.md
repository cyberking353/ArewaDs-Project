# ArewaDs Project (Working With APIs)

This project is conducted as a final requirement for the [Arewa Data Science Python Programming Fellowship](https://arewadatascience.github.io/). The project worked on [Github's API](https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python&sort=stars) and [Hacker News API](https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/42796950.json). We extracted and visualize the data from the API.
